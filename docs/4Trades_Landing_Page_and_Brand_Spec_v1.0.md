**SECTION 1 --- THE CHALLENGE**

**Headline:\
Local trades are being bought out---and it's changing how communities
get service.**

**Body:\
Across the country, investment groups are buying up family-owned trades
businesses.\
They rebrand them, centralize their operations, and use automation to
out-scale everyone else.**

**That might work for them---but it leaves local owners competing
against national chains with corporate budgets.**

**At 4Trades.ai, we believe the trades should stay local, reliable, and
proudly independent.\
So we built the tools that help you keep it that way.**

**Visual:\
Split image or slider --- "Corporate Roll-Up" vs. "Independent
Business."\
